# SlideFeedback


## Introduction
Most students know the feeling, you're attending a lecture and the lecturer goes so fast through the materials you get confused. Or the lecturer goes on and on about subjects that were dealt with earlier. Raising your hand interrupts the lecture however so there is no good way to do something about this, yet...

This problem I try to solve by building an application. When the lecturer uses my application to display his slideshows the students will have the possibility to follow the slideshow on their phones/tablets. But most important: they can send their feedback (either too slow or too fast) to the lecturer. The feedback of course will not be displayed in an intrusive manner, but just as a subtle notification, and only when a certain fraction of the students submits the same feedback.

This idea is born during one of my earlier courses, where my team developed an idea for a system that provides adaptive slides during lectures. The feedback was a part of this, but some lecturers showed interest in primarily this part of the system. This drove me to choose the feedback on slides as subject for this project.
